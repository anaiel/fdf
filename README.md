# FdF

This project was completed in February 2019 as part of the 42 school cursus. The aim is to generate a grid using the minilibx visual library from map files. The complete instruction can be found [here](https://github.com/Binary-Hackers/42_Subjects/blob/master/00_Projects/03_Graphic/fdf.pdf).
As an added bonus, this project offers:
* different color schemes (one generated from the map, a static rainbow, a changing rainbow, and one generated from the altitude given on the map to emulate a terrain map)
* zooming
* moving the grid
* rotating the map

## Getting Started

Clone the repository. The project uses the minilibx library which can be found in the `resources/` folder. To install the minilibx library, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/pbondoer/MinilibX).
Compile the project using `make`, then you can try with any of the maps in the `resources/maps` folder.

## Examples

```
./fdf resources/42.fdf
```
```
./fdf resources/julia.fdf
